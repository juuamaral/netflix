# Netflix: Exploratory Data Analysis

Using a Kaggle dataset containing information about Netflix's portfolio, I conducted an exploratory analysis to gain deeper insights into the world of this incredible streaming platform.

# How many titles are available on Netflix?

To begin, I examined the total number of titles, noting that the dataset is from 2021 and divided into movies and series:

As we can see, Netflix offers approximately 6,000 movies and nearly 3,000 series.

# Which year did Netflix add the most titles to its catalog?

Next, I explored the timeline to determine when Netflix added the highest number of titles to its library.

Starting in late 2016, the number of titles added each year increased significantly, with a peak between April 2019 and June 2019, when 87 titles were added.

# Are these titles recent or older?

To dig deeper, I analyzed the release years of the titles in the catalog.

The Netflix catalog is predominantly composed of newer titles, with the majority released in 2018.

# Where do most of these titles come from?

I then looked into the countries contributing the most titles to the Netflix catalog.

As expected, the United States leads by a wide margin, followed by India. But how are movies distributed across the globe?

The majority of titles are rated for a mature audience (TV-MA), followed by content suitable for viewers aged 14 and above (TV-14).
