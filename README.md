# Netflix: Exploratory Data Analysis

As one of the leading global streaming platforms, Netflix continually evolves its content strategy to cater to a diverse and expanding audience. The goal of this analysis is to explore trends in Netflix's catalog and provide insights into its growth, content diversity, and audience targeting strategies. To achieve this, I utilized a comprehensive Kaggle dataset containing detailed information about Netflix's portfolio as of 2021. Through this exploratory data analysis, I aimed to uncover the underlying patterns and dynamics that drive Netflix's content acquisition and distribution, offering a deeper understanding of its competitive positioning in the streaming industry.

# How many titles are available on Netflix?

To begin, I examined the total number of titles, noting that the dataset is from 2021 and divided into movies and series:

As we can see, Netflix offers approximately 6,000 movies and nearly 3,000 series.

# Which year did Netflix add the most titles to its catalog?

Next, I explored the timeline to determine when Netflix added the highest number of titles to its library.

Starting in late 2016, the number of titles added each year increased significantly, with a peak between April 2019 and June 2019, when 87 titles were added.

# Are these titles recent or older?

To dig deeper, I analyzed the release years of the titles in the catalog.

The Netflix catalog is predominantly composed of newer titles, with the majority released in 2018.

# Where do most of these titles come from?

I then looked into the countries contributing the most titles to the Netflix catalog.

As expected, the United States leads by a wide margin, followed by India. But how are movies distributed across the globe?

The majority of titles are rated for a mature audience (TV-MA), followed by content suitable for viewers aged 14 and above (TV-14).

This analysis highlights Netflix's strategic focus on recent content, its dominance in the U.S. market, and its effort to diversify its global catalog. These trends underline the company's competitive approach to maintaining its position as a leader in the streaming industry.
