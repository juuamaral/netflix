# Netflix

Using a Kaggle dataset containing information about Netflix's portfolio, I conducted some exploratory analyses to gain a deeper understanding of the world of this incredible streaming platform.

To start, I wanted to understand the total number of titles on Netflix, knowing that the dataset is from 2021 and is divided into movies and series:

As we can see, Netflix has approximately 6,000 movies and nearly 3,000 series.

The second question I wanted to answer is: Which year did Netflix add more titles to the catalogue?

We can see that from the end of 2016 onward, the number of titles added increased, with the maximum between April 2019 and June 2019, with 87 titles added.
But what about the release year of these titles? Are they recent or older?

The netflix catalogue has more newest titles, especially the ones released in 2018.
Are most of titles from any country?

Of course most of the titles are from the USA, followed by India.
